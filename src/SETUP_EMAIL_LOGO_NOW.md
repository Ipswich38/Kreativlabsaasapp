## 💡 WHY BASE64?

Email clients can't load images from your local app files. They need images to be:
- Hosted online (like Imgur, Cloudinary), OR
- Embedded as base64 (what we're doing - most reliable!)

Base64 = Your logo converted to a text string and embedded directly in the email HTML.

**Result:** Perfect logo display in ALL email clients! 📧✨
