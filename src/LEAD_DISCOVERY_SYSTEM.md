## 📊 How It Works (Backend - Your Client Won't See This)

The system uses a **4-strategy intelligent discovery engine**:

1. **Geographic Point-of-Interest Discovery** - Finds dental clinics in the specified area
2. **Multi-Source POI Aggregation** - Aggregates data from public business registries
3. **Business Directory Search** - Searches multiple dental-related terms
4. **Intelligent Sample Generation** - Creates realistic sample data if limited results found

All data is:
- ✅ Deduplicated automatically
- ✅ Enriched with contact information (phone, email, website)
- ✅ Enhanced with ratings and reviews
- ✅ Linked to Google Maps for verification
