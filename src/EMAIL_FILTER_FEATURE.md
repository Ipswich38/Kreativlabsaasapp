## 🎯 How It Works

### Email Discovery Strategy

The system now attempts to find **PUBLIC emails** from business directories using a 3-tier approach:

#### 1. **Real Email Discovery**
- Searches for `email`, `contact:email` tags in public business data
- These are marked as **verified** and shown without any badge

#### 2. **Smart Email Generation (from website)**
- If a business has a website but no email, generates realistic email like:
  - `info@brightsmile.com`
  - `contact@dentalcare.com`
  - `office@familydentistry.com`
- Uses the actual business domain from their website
- Marked with **"Est."** badge (Estimated)

#### 3. **Fallback Email Generation**
- If no website or email found, generates based on business name
- Example: "Bright Smile Dental" → `info@brightsmile.dental`
- Also marked with **"Est."** badge

## 📋 New Filter Added

### "Must have email" Checkbox

When checked, this filter will:
- ✅ **Only show leads with REAL verified emails** (no generated ones)
- ✅ Excludes any leads where email was estimated
- ✅ Ensures privacy compliance (only public emails)

When **NOT** checked (default):
- Shows ALL results
- Displays both verified and estimated emails
- Clearly marks estimated emails with "Est." badge

## 🎨 UI Updates

### Results Summary
Now shows 5 stats instead of 4:
1. **Businesses found** - Total count
2. **With emails** - Only counts REAL verified emails (not estimated)
3. **With phones** - Phone number count
4. **With websites** - Website count
5. **Avg rating** - Average rating

### Results Table
Each email cell now shows:
- ✅ **Verified email**: `admin@dentalclinic.com` (no badge)
- 📧 **Estimated email**: `info@dentalclinic.com` + **Est.** badge in amber
- ❌ **No email**: "No email" in gray text

### Phone Numbers
- Shows actual phone if available
- Shows "No phone" in gray if unavailable

## 🔒 Privacy & Compliance

### Important Safeguards:

1. **Public Data Only**
   - System only searches public business directories
   - No web scraping of private websites
   - No harvesting from social media

2. **Clear Labeling**
   - All estimated emails are clearly marked with "Est." badge
   - Users can filter to only show verified emails
   - No misleading data presentation

3. **Opt-Out Friendly**
   - Generated emails are estimates based on public business info
   - Real emails come from public business listings
   - Businesses can update their public listings anytime

## 💡 Client Presentation

**What to say:**
"Our system searches public business directories to find dental clinics with contact information. When we find verified emails from their public listings, we show them directly. For businesses that don't have emails in public directories but have websites, we estimate their likely contact email based on industry standards. You can filter to only show verified emails if you prefer."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ All data from public sources
- ✅ Clear labeling of verified vs estimated
- ✅ Privacy compliant
- ✅ Professional and transparent
