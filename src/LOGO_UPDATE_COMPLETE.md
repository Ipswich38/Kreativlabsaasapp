## 🎯 Logo Specifications

### For React Components (Site UI)
```tsx
import logo from 'figma:asset/4d778675bb728bb5595e9394dadabf32025b40c1.png';

// Usage
<img src={logo} alt="Happy Teeth Logo" className="w-16 h-16 rounded-lg" />
```

### For Email Templates (HTML)
```html
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DlT9k8y.png" 
     alt="Happy Teeth Logo" 
     style="width: 80px; height: 80px; margin: 0 auto 15px; 
            display: block; border-radius: 12px;" />
```

**Why different sources?**
- **React components:** Use Figma asset (works in app)
- **Email templates:** Use hosted image URL (works in email clients)
