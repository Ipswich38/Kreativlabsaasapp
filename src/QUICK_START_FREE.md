## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Start Without Filters
```
First search: Uncheck "Must have phone" and "Must have website"
→ See all available dental clinics
→ Check data quality for your area

Then: Apply filters if needed
→ Enable "Must have phone" if you need phones
→ Enable "Must have website" if you need sites
```

### 2. Use Broad Locations
✅ **Good searches:**
- "New York, NY"
- "Los Angeles, CA"
- "60601" (Chicago ZIP)
- "Boston"

❌ **Too specific:**
- "123 Main Street, New York"
- Very small towns (might have limited data)

### 3. Expect Variation
- Urban areas = Better data (60%+ phone coverage)
- Rural areas = Less complete (20-40% phone coverage)
- USA/Europe = Excellent coverage
- Other regions = Good but varies
