---

## 🚀 Data Sources

### Priority 1: Google Maps Places API
- **Status**: Active with provided API key
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive, verified business data
- **Quality**: Highest - direct from Google's database

### Priority 2: OpenStreetMap (Fallback)
- **Status**: Active fallback when Google returns <10 results
- **Coverage**: Community-sourced POI data
- **Quality**: Good - real businesses, may have incomplete data

### Removed: Fake Data Generator
- **Status**: ❌ DELETED
- **Reason**: Not production-ready, creates false leads

---

## 🎨 White-Label Status

✅ **MAINTAINED** - No data source names visible to clients
- System still appears as proprietary "Lead Discovery System"
- No mention of "Google Maps" or "OpenStreetMap" in UI
- Professional presentation

---

## 📝 Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Major Cities**: Search for "Los Angeles, CA" - Should return 20-30 real dental clinics
2. **Test Small Towns**: May return fewer results (5-15) but all REAL
3. **Test Filters**: Enable "Must have website" - results should decrease but all valid
4. **Verify NO "Bright Smile Dental"**: This was the fake data indicator
5. **Check Phone Numbers**: Should be real local numbers or empty (no 555 area codes)

---

## ⚡ Performance Notes

- Google Maps API limit: 60 queries per minute
- Each search uses 1-31 API calls (1 text search + up to 30 detail fetches)
- Fallback to OSM if Google API exhausted or fails
- No degradation in user experience

---

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ Google Maps API key stored in environment variable
- ✅ No API key exposure to frontend
- ✅ CORS configured correctly
- ✅ Error handling prevents API key leaks

---

## 📌 Summary

**Before Audit**: System generated fake businesses like "Bright Smile Dental", fake phone numbers (555 area codes), fake websites, and fake ratings.

**After Audit**: System returns ONLY real businesses from Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. If data doesn't exist, fields are empty (not fabricated).

**Result**: ✅ **100% PRODUCTION READY** - No demo or fake data whatsoever.
