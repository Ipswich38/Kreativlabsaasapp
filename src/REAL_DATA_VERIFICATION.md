## 🎨 How Email Estimation Works (When Real Email Not Available)

When OpenStreetMap doesn't have a real email address, the system creates a **professional estimated email**:

### Method 1: Website-Based
If the business has a real website in OSM:
```
Real Website: www.smithfamilydental.com
Estimated Email: info@smithfamilydental.com
```

### Method 2: Business Name-Based
If no website is available:
```
Business Name: Smith Family Dental
Estimated Email: contact@smithfamilydental.com
```

### Common Professional Prefixes Used:
- info@
- contact@
- admin@
- office@
- reception@
- appointments@

### Visual Indicator
All estimated emails show this badge in the results:
```
📧 info@smithfamilydental.com [Est.]
```

**Important:** Real verified emails from OSM show "✓ Verified" badge!
