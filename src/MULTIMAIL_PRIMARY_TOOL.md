## Technical Architecture

### Frontend: `/components/Multimail.tsx`
```typescript
// Pre-loaded template constants
const DEFAULT_SUBJECT = 'Reclaim Your Time...';
const DEFAULT_MESSAGE = 'Hi Dental Practice Leaders...';

// Component features:
- useState for recipient selection
- useState for subject/message (initialized with defaults)
- handleSelectAll for bulk selection
- handleContactToggle for individual selection
- handleSendEmails for API call
- Reset to Default Template button
```

### Backend: `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`
```typescript
// Endpoint: /make-server-aed69b82/gmail-multimail-send
POST request with:
- recipients: array of contact objects
- subject: email subject line
- message: email body text

Server:
1. Validates recipients (max 10 per batch)
2. Gets Imgur logo URL
3. Creates HTML email with letterhead
4. Sends via Gmail SMTP (nodemailer)
5. Returns success/failure counts
```

### Logo System
```typescript
// Frontend components
const logo = 'https://i.imgur.com/LMJEwlp.png';

// Server-side
const IMGUR_LOGO_URL = 'https://i.imgur.com/LMJEwlp.png';
const logoUrl = await getLogoPublicURL(); // Returns Imgur URL
```

## Advantages Over Email Blast

| Feature | Email Blast (Removed) | Multimail (Current) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Email Format | Plain text | Professional HTML |
| Logo in Email | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Imgur CDN) |
| Letterhead | ❌ No | ✅ 3-column design |
| Pre-loaded Template | ❌ No | ✅ Dental outreach |
| Reset Template | ❌ No | ✅ One-click reset |
| Batch Control | ⚠️ No limit | ✅ Max 10 per batch |
| Delivery Method | Gmail SMTP | Gmail SMTP |
| UI Polish | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Modern & clean |
| Recipient Preview | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Full preview |

---

## Batch Sending Guide

To send to more than 10 contacts:

### Option 1: Manual Batching
1. Select first 10 contacts
2. Send email campaign
3. Wait for success confirmation
4. Select next 10 contacts
5. Repeat

### Option 2: Segment Your List
- Create multiple campaigns targeting different segments
- Example: "North Region Dental Practices" (10 contacts)
- Then: "South Region Dental Practices" (10 contacts)

### Why 10 Recipient Limit?
- **Server Resource Protection:** Prevents timeout issues
- **Better Deliverability:** Smaller batches have higher success rates
- **Gmail Best Practices:** Avoid triggering spam filters
- **Error Management:** Easier to track and fix issues

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No recipients selected"
**Solution:** Select at least one contact with an email address

### "Too many recipients"
**Solution:** Reduce selection to 10 or fewer contacts

### "Failed to send"
**Check:**
1. Gmail SMTP credentials are correct (hardcoded in server)
2. Recipients have valid email addresses
3. Internet connection is stable
4. Server is running

### Logo not showing in emails
**Solution:** Logo is on Imgur CDN - should always work. If not:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Imgur URL is accessible: `https://i.imgur.com/LMJEwlp.png`
3. Email client may be blocking images (ask recipient to "load images")
