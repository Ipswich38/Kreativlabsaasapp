   - Make sure 2FA is enabled on Gmail
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **Check recipients**
   - Make sure email addresses are valid
   - Verify contacts have email field filled
   - Test with one recipient first

3. **Check console**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for error messages
   - Check server logs in Supabase

### If Logo Doesn't Appear:

- Logo is embedded as base64 (should always work)
