## 🔍 How It Works

### Step 1: Location Geocoding
```
User enters: "New York, NY"
     ↓
Nominatim API (OSM's geocoding service)
     ↓
Returns: Latitude, Longitude, Bounding Box
```

### Step 2: Business Search
```
Bounding Box coordinates
     ↓
Overpass API (OSM's query service)
     ↓
Search for: amenity="dentist" OR healthcare="dentist"
     ↓
Returns: Array of dental clinic locations
```

### Step 3: Data Extraction
```
For each business:
  - Extract name
  - Extract address (street, city, state, ZIP)
  - Extract phone (if available)
  - Extract website (if available)
  - Generate email (estimated)
  - Create OpenStreetMap URL
```

### Step 4: Filtering
```
Apply user filters:
  - Must have phone? ✓
  - Must have website? ✓
     ↓
Return filtered results
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Use Broad Locations
✅ **Good:** "New York, NY"
✅ **Good:** "Los Angeles, CA"
❌ **Too Specific:** "123 Main St, New York"

### 2. Don't Use "Must Have" Filters Initially
```
First search: No filters
  → See all results
  → Check data quality for your area

Then: Apply filters if needed
  → Must have phone
  → Must have website
```

### 3. Try Different Search Terms
- City + State: "Chicago, IL"
- ZIP Code: "60601"
- City only: "Boston"

### 4. Expect Some Missing Data
- Phone numbers might be missing (30-60%)
- Websites might be missing (60-80%)
- This is normal for open-source data

**A:** Yes! OSM is used by major companies like Apple, Facebook, and Uber. The data is community-verified and constantly updated.

**A:** OSM is updated continuously by thousands of contributors worldwide. Major changes appear within days. However, business details like phone numbers update slower than Google Maps.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No dental clinics found"
**Possible causes:**
- Location too specific (try broader search)
- Few OSM-mapped dentists in that area
- Try nearby city

**Solutions:**
1. Search broader area (city vs ZIP)
2. Try multiple nearby cities
3. Check filters (disable "must have" options)
4. Or add Google Maps API for more results

### "Location not found"
**Possible causes:**
- Typo in city/state name
- Unknown ZIP code

**Solutions:**
1. Check spelling
2. Try "City, State" format
3. Use full state name or abbreviation

### Slow searches
**Normal!** OSM queries can take 3-6 seconds. This is expected for free data.
