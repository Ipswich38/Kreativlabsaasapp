## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP FIX (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

1. **Go to:** https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. **Login** with sshappyteeth@gmail.com
3. **Scroll to** "How you sign in to Google"
4. **Click** "2-Step Verification"
5. **Follow the setup** if not already enabled
6. **Verify** it shows as "ON"

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST have 2-Step Verification enabled to create App Passwords!

### Step 2: Generate NEW App Password

1. **Go to:** https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - You may need to sign in again
   
2. **If you see "You can't create App Passwords":**
   - Go back to Step 1 and enable 2-Step Verification first
   
3. **Select app:** Choose "Mail"

4. **Select device:** Choose "Other (Custom name)"
   - Type: **"KreativLab CRM"**
   
5. **Click "Generate"**

6. **COPY THE PASSWORD:**
   - Google will show a 16-character password with spaces
   - Example: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - **YOU MUST REMOVE ALL SPACES!**
   - Correct format: `abcdefghijklmnop`

7. **Save it immediately** - you can only see it once!

### Step 3: Update Server Code

1. **Open file:** `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`

2. **Find line 17-21** (the GMAIL_CONFIG section):
   ```typescript
   const GMAIL_CONFIG = {
     gmailAddress: 'sshappyteeth@gmail.com',
     appPassword: 'wvnbgpmnkupothrh',  // ‚Üê REPLACE THIS
     senderName: 'Happy Teeth Support Services',
   };
   ```

3. **Replace the appPassword** with your NEW password (NO SPACES):
   ```typescript
   const GMAIL_CONFIG = {
     gmailAddress: 'sshappyteeth@gmail.com',
     appPassword: 'YOUR_NEW_16_CHAR_PASSWORD',  // ‚Üê Paste here
     senderName: 'Happy Teeth Support Services',
   };
   ```

4. **Save the file** - the server will auto-reload

4. **If still failing:**
   - Double-check you removed ALL spaces from the App Password

   - Generate a NEW App Password and try again
