## Date: October 29, 2025

## What Was Removed

The **Email Blast** tab and component have been removed from KreativLab CRM to streamline the email functionality. **Multimail is now the primary and only email tool** in the application.

---

## Files Deleted

1. ✅ `/components/EmailBlast.tsx` - Complete component removed

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/App.tsx`
- ❌ Removed `EmailBlast` import
- ❌ Removed `case 'email-blast'` from view rendering logic

### 2. `/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- ❌ Removed Email Blast menu item from sidebar
- ✅ Sidebar now shows:
  - Dashboard
  - Contacts Management
  - Lead Generation
  - **Multimail (PRO)** - Advanced Tools section

---

## Why This Change?

### Consolidation of Email Features
- **Before:** Two separate email tools (Email Blast + Multimail)
- **After:** Single unified email tool (Multimail)

### Multimail Advantages
1. **Professional HTML Templates:** 3-column letterhead with Happy Teeth logo
2. **Gmail SMTP Integration:** Reliable delivery via Gmail infrastructure
3. **Pre-loaded Templates:** Dental practice outreach content ready to customize
4. **Batch Sending:** Intelligent batching with 10 recipients max per batch
5. **Modern UI:** Better user experience with recipient selection and preview

### Email Blast Limitations
- Basic plain text emails
- Less polished UI
- Redundant functionality now covered by Multimail

---

## Server Endpoints (Unchanged)

The server still maintains these email endpoints:

1. ✅ `/make-server-aed69b82/gmail-multimail-send` - **PRIMARY EMAIL TOOL**
   - Used by Multimail component
   - Professional HTML emails with Happy Teeth letterhead
   - Gmail SMTP delivery
   
2. ⚠️ `/make-server-aed69b82/send-email` - **DEPRECATED (kept for legacy)**
   - Previously used by Email Blast component
   - Still functional but not used by frontend
   - Can be removed in future cleanup

3. ✅ `/make-server-aed69b82/test-email` - For testing SMTP configuration
