# 📧 Multimail Batch Sending Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Resource Limits

The "WORKER_LIMIT" error has been resolved! Here's what was done:

### What Was Wrong

The server was running out of compute resources when:
1. Fetching logo from database on every request
2. Creating email HTML templates for many recipients
3. Processing too many emails at once

### What Was Fixed

**1. Optimized Logo Loading:**
- Logo URL is now **cached** (fetched once, reused)
- No repeated Supabase Storage calls
- Faster email generation

**2. Added Batch Limits:**
- Maximum **10 recipients per batch**
- Prevents resource exhaustion
- Ensures reliable delivery

**3. Simplified HTML Templates:**
- Minified HTML to reduce memory
- Pre-generate logo HTML once
- More efficient string operations

**4. Better Error Handling:**
- Clear error messages
- Helpful guidance for users

  - ✅ Solution: Deselect some, send in groups of 10

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Recommended Batch Sizes

| Contacts | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| 1-10 | ✅ Send all at once |
| 11-20 | 📦 Send in 2 batches |
| 21-50 | 📦 Send in 5 batches |
| 50+ | 📦 Send in batches of 10 |

### Tips for Efficiency

**1. Sort Your Contacts**
- Group by priority (hot leads first)
- Sort by status (new, contacted, follow-up)

**2. Test First**
- Send to yourself first
- Verify logo displays correctly
- Check formatting looks good

**3. Track Progress**
- Keep notes on which batch you've sent
- Mark contacts as "emailed" after sending
- Use status field in CRM

**4. Timing**

- Best times: 9am-11am or 2pm-4pm
