## 🎯 TECHNICAL DETAILS (How It Works):

### **Frontend (Already Active):**
- Logo imported from Figma asset
- Displays in all React components
- Fast loading, cached by browser

### **Email System (Needs Activation):**
1. Admin clicks "Convert" → Logo converted to base64
2. Admin clicks "Upload" → Base64 sent to email server
3. Email server stores base64 in memory
4. All emails use this base64 to show logo
5. Works in ALL email clients (no broken images!)

### **Why Base64 for Emails?**
- Email clients can't access local files
- Email clients CAN embed base64 images
- Base64 = Reliable across Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.
- One-time setup, works forever!

## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:

```html
<!-- Before Logo Upload -->
<div class="header">
  <div class="logo">Happy Teeth Support Services</div>
</div>

<!-- After Logo Upload (Automatic!) -->
<div class="header">
  <img 
    src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..." 
    alt="Happy Teeth Support Services" 
    style="width: 180px; height: auto; border-radius: 12px;"
  />
</div>
```

The email server automatically switches from text to logo once you upload!

## 🎨 LOGO SPECIFICATIONS:

- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Dimensions:** Square (maintains aspect ratio)
- **Display Size in Emails:** 180px wide
- **Background:** White/transparent (works on pink gradient)
- **Border Radius:** 12px (smooth corners)

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### **"I don't see the Logo Converter in admin dashboard"**
- Make sure you're logged in as `kreativlab` (admin)
- Regular users (`htsscrm`) don't see this feature

### **"Convert button doesn't work"**
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure you have internet connection

### **"Upload button doesn't work"**
- Check that conversion completed first
- Look for base64 code displayed on screen
- Refresh and try again

### **"Logo still not showing in emails"**
- Make sure you clicked BOTH buttons (1️⃣ and 2️⃣)
- Look for green "Logo Active in Emails!" message
- Test again with SMTP test button
