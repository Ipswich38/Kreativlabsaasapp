# üîß Fix Broken Logo in Emails - 3 Simple Steps

## Problem
‚úÖ Logo shows perfectly in the email compose form  
‚ùå Logo broken when email is received (shows broken image icon)

## Why This Happens
- The compose form uses the local logo file (works in browser)
- Sent emails need base64 embedded logo (doesn't work yet because server has placeholder text)

## Solution - Use the Built-in Logo Converter

### Step 1: Login as Admin
- Username: `kreativlab`
- Password: `272829`

You'll see the "Logo to Base64 Converter" section with 3 buttons:

1. Click **"1Ô∏è‚É£ Convert Logo to Base64"** 
   - Wait 1-2 seconds for conversion

2. Click **"2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload to Email Server"**
   - You'll see: "üéâ Logo uploaded! Your emails will now show the Happy Teeth logo!"

3. Click **"3Ô∏è‚É£ Send Test Email"**
   - Check sshappyteeth@gmail.com inbox
   - You should now see the logo perfectly! ‚ú®

After these 3 clicks, ALL emails sent from the CRM will display your Happy Teeth logo beautifully.

## What This Does Technically
The Logo Converter:
1. Converts your Happy Teeth logo PNG to base64 format
2. Uploads it to the email server 
3. Server stores it in the `EMAIL_LOGO_BASE64` variable
4. All emails now include the embedded logo

No manual pasting needed! üéâ
